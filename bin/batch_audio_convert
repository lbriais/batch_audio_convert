  DESCRIPTION = <<DESCR
This application batch-transforms audio files from your central media library from one 
format to another. It basically takes the assumption that the audio library is already 
correctly organized in two levels directory structure that could be:
- artist/album
- various/compil
Nevertheless the files or directories specified could be located anywhere. Only the 
structure is assumed.

It actually replicates the original structure and copies all the tags (handled by taglib)
to the generated audio files.

Currently only manages FLAC to OGG, all other files are copied untouched.
